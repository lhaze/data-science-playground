# data-science-playground

Let's have some fun with a bunch of libs & approaches.

Under development:
---
* [how_many_wraiths](how_many_wraiths): modelling population dynamics within alternate-reality RPG setting; basic resarch on historic data of demography; some utility code for models; simple data visualization.
* [jats](jats): automation of PDF processing; turning PDF representation of a journal article into a semantic XML ([JATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_Article_Tag_Suite)); pipelining and clustering the process; long term goal to introduce some [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing)-jutsu and rule-based domain system into the process to leverage the quality of semantic markup.

Ideas:
---
* trajectory: simulation of trajectories of space vehicles within Solar system; modelling the kinetics of orbital mechanics; visualization via animations.
* github analysis: information retrival and extraction via GitHub API; find repos with some kind of pattern (some vulnerability and a living webapp?); abstract sytax tree analysis; IR storage application.
