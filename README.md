# data-science-playground

###### Let's have some fun with a set of libs & approaches.
Here is a bunch of my toy projects on topic such as data processing, data mining & process modelling. All flavored with my geeky hobbies.

Under development:
---
#### [how_many_wraiths](how_many_wraiths)
* modelling population dynamics within alternate-reality fantasy setting
* basic research on historic data of demography
* some utility code for models
* simple data visualization
* `pandas`, `matplotlib`/`pylab`, `YAML`

#### [jats](jats)
* medical journal articles in PDF format as input
* automation of conversion from PDF to semantic XML ([JATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_Article_Tag_Suite))
* pipelining and clustering the process
* long term goal to introduce some [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing)-jutsu and rule-based domain system into the process to leverage the quality of semantic markup
* `pdfx`, `requests`, `lxml`, `PySpark`

Ideas:
---
#### trajectory
* simulation of trajectories of space vehicles within Solar system
* modelling the kinetics of [orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics)
* visualization via animations
* `simpy`, `PyEphem`, `sky-charts`, `Gizeh`, `MoviePy`/`visual`

#### github analysis
* heuristic static code analysis & machine reasoning about code
* information retrieval and extraction via GitHub API
* find repos with some kind of pattern (some vulnerability and a living webapp?)
* [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) analysis
* application of a IR storage
* `github3`, `PySpark`, `ast`, `elasticsearch`

#### honeypot logs
* behavior modelling on a complex domain: IT security
* information extraction from nginx/webapp logs
* modelling concepts of harmful user activity
* multi-layer rule-based rough classifiers
* `PySpark`, `scikit`
