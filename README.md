# data-science-playground

Let's have some fun with a bunch of libs & approaches.

Under development:
---
* [how_many_wraiths](how_many_wraiths): modelling population dynamics within alternate-reality fantasy setting; basic research on historic data of demography; some utility code for models; simple data visualization.
* [jats](jats): automation of PDF processing; turning PDF representation of a journal article into a semantic XML ([JATS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_Article_Tag_Suite)); pipelining and clustering the process; long term goal to introduce some [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing)-jutsu and rule-based domain system into the process to leverage the quality of semantic markup.

Ideas:
---
* trajectory: simulation of trajectories of space vehicles within Solar system; modelling the kinetics of [orbital mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics); visualization via animations.
* github analysis: information retrieval and extraction via GitHub API; find repos with some kind of pattern (some vulnerability and a living webapp?); [abstract syntax tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) analysis; application of a IR storage.
* honeypot logs: information extraction from nginx/webapp logs; modelling of user behavior; multilayer rule-based classifiers of harmful user activity.
